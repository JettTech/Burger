# Burger
A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, display their burger titles, and "eat" them, all through a few clicks. This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM, and employs CRUD standards to implement the changes in burger states (ie. ordered/eaten/disappeared).
