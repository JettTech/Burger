# Burger
This is the Sequelize version of the Burger2 App - A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, display their burger titles, and "eat" them, all through a few clicks. 

This app version uses Node, Express, Handlebars completes all the same CRUD functionality using Sequelize instead of mySQL and a custom made ORM.
